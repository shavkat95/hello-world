# hello-world
my first repository for exercise purposes 

this project is made in the hardest of times, when hard decisions need to be made and hard work needs to be done. When there is no time to play games or time to waste on stupid people. Hence I focus on learning. Learning how Information-Tech works, how life works and how to live and act as a responsible and competent person. To become a responsible, powerfull and world changing personality.
